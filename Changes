    - added support for capture() merging STDERR and STDOUT to the same
      scalar, i.e. "capture( \&foo, \$out, \$out )" (RT#24695)

    - added capture_exec_combined() and alias qxy() to merge STDERR and STDOUT
      for subprocess execution (RT#29289)
    
    - bugfix: stop crashing if output filehandles are previously closed or
      if running without a console on MSWin32 (i.e. wperl.exe) (RT#23676)

    - cleaned up documentation for consistency

    - DAGOLDEN added as maintainer; updated build system and packaging for

    - bugfix: capture.t would fail on Win32 if Inline::C was installed; 
      fixed the sample C code used in testing to flush stderr (RT#21712)
